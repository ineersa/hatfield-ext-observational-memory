# OM retrieval calibration

This report covers two calibrations on the same disposable index of 9,352 memories and 9,364 chunks (`var/tmp/om-semantic-benchmark-5eb55cac6288c6e3/`), not the live OM database. Private candidate texts, endpoint bodies, and numeric run files stay under ignored `.hatfield/tmp/`. Tracked files keep questions, source IDs, and aggregate measurements only.

The frozen question set is [relevance-calibration-questions.json](relevance-calibration-questions.json). Cases 1–33 are unchanged from the first calibration. Cases 34–50 add 13 observation paraphrase questions and 4 hard negatives. Splits were frozen before scoring: 22 calibration / 16 held-out positives, and 6 / 6 negatives.

Judging reads collapsed parent memories without scores. A result counts as relevant only when it answers or directly supports the question. Session or target ID alone is not enough. Precision counts those first-ten or first-twenty slots for every question, including negatives.

## Historical baseline (33 questions, 2026-09-22)

The first calibration chose reranker floor **-4** on 25 positives and 8 negatives (15+4 calibration, 10+4 held out) using production retrieval (`maxItems=100`, fused top 100, CombinedStore `rrfK=60`).

| Split and floor | Relevant / returned, first ten | Precision | Positive questions with a relevant hit | Exact target hits | Negative questions with any hit |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Calibration, no floor | 83 / 190 | 43.7% | 15 / 15 | 8 / 15 | 4 / 4 |
| Calibration, -4 | 77 / 115 | 67.0% | 14 / 15 | 8 / 15 | 2 / 4 |
| Held out, no floor | 21 / 140 | 15.0% | 8 / 10 | 3 / 10 | 4 / 4 |
| Held out, -4 | 11 / 51 | 21.6% | 6 / 10 | 2 / 10 | 2 / 4 |

That floor raised judged precision and cut some negative hits, but held-out topic coverage fell from 8/10 to 6/10. No tested scalar floor both rejected unrelated text and preserved recall. Retrieval misses before the floor cannot be repaired by the floor.

## Candidate-stage results (50 questions)

Symfony AI `CombinedStore` uses reciprocal rank fusion with default `rrfK=60`. At measurement time, code passed `maxItems => 100` into each store adapter, then sliced the fused list to 100 before optional reranking. The adopted candidate budget is now 200 fused chunks with the same per-store budget. RRF scores are ranking scores, not confidence. Do not threshold them.

Exact-target recall before reranking:

| Split | Per-store budget | Vector | BM25 | RRF top 50 | RRF top 100 | RRF top 200 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Calibration | 50 | 19/22 | 15/22 | 19/22 | 20/22 | — |
| Calibration | 100 | 21/22 | 17/22 | 21/22 | 22/22 | 22/22 |
| Calibration | 200 | 22/22 | 21/22 | 21/22 | 22/22 | 22/22 |
| Held out | 50 | 8/16 | 9/16 | 9/16 | 11/16 | — |
| Held out | 100 | 11/16 | 12/16 | 9/16 | 11/16 | 16/16 |
| Held out | 200 | 11/16 | 12/16 | 9/16 | 11/16 | 16/16 |

At production budget 100 / fused 100, five held-out targets sit in one store’s top 100 but outside the fused top 100 (`fork_resume`, `jbcontext`, `unicode`, `human_input`, `persistence`). Raising only the fused cutoff to 200 with the same per-store budget recovers all five as candidates. Raising per-store budget from 100 to 200 without raising fused N does not. Changing `rrfK` among 20 / 60 / 100 did not change fused-100 exact recall on this set.

Miss classes at production fused 100:

- No lexical and no vector hit inside the store budget: none on the calibration positives; held-out gaps are dominated by fused truncation and later rerank/floor loss.
- Present in BM25 or vector top 100, dropped by fused top 100: the five held-out cases above.
- Present after fusion, lost to reranker floor -4: several held-out exact targets (for example `child_status`, `logging`, `compact_castor`).

## Exact targets after rerank: “all retained” is not tool-visible

The held-out row “16/16 after rerank” for fused 200 / no floor means every exact target stays somewhere in the collapsed parent list from those 200 chunks. It is not a claim about the tool’s first ten or twenty results.

Exact-target hits inside the first ten and first twenty returned parents (per-store 100, CombinedStore `rrfK=60`):

| Split | Fused N | Floor | Exact @10 | Exact @20 | Exact anywhere in returned parents |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Calibration | 100 | none | 15/22 | 20/22 | 22/22 |
| Calibration | 100 | -4 | 15/22 | 18/22 | 18/22 |
| Calibration | 200 | none | 15/22 | 20/22 | 22/22 |
| Calibration | 200 | -4 | 15/22 | 18/22 | 18/22 |
| Held out | 100 | none | 9/16 | 10/16 | 11/16 |
| Held out | 100 | -4 | 8/16 | 8/16 | 8/16 |
| Held out | 200 | none | 9/16 | 12/16 | 16/16 |
| Held out | 200 | -4 | 9/16 | 10/16 | 10/16 |

On held-out questions, widening fused N from 100 to 200 with floor -4 moves exact @10 from 8/16 to 9/16 and exact @20 from 8/16 to 10/16. The no-floor @20 gain is larger (10/16 → 12/16), but every negative still returns hits. The six “anywhere” recoveries at N=200 / no floor include ranks past 20 (`fork_resume` 29, `jbcontext` 58, `unicode` 59). Those parents are in the candidate set; they are not in a normal top-ten answer list.

## Reranker floors on the 50-question set

Exact-target retention after reranking (anywhere in the filtered parent list, not topical precision):

| Split | Candidates | No floor | Floor -4 | Floor -3 | Floor 0 |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Calibration | 100 / 100 | 22/22 | 18/22 | 14/22 | 8/22 |
| Held out | 100 / 100 | 11/16 | 8/16 | 7/16 | 5/16 |
| Held out | 200 / 200 | 16/16 | 10/16 | 9/16 | 5/16 |

Judged first-ten topical metrics on production 100 / 100 (labels frozen from that first-ten list):

| Split and floor | Relevant / returned, first ten | Precision | Positive questions with a relevant hit | Exact target hits | Negative questions with any hit |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Calibration, no floor | 88 / 280 | 31.4% | 22 / 22 | 15 / 22 | 6 / 6 |
| Calibration, -4 | 83 / 168 | 49.4% | 21 / 22 | 15 / 22 | 2 / 6 |
| Held out, no floor | 25 / 220 | 11.4% | 13 / 16 | 9 / 16 | 6 / 6 |
| Held out, -4 | 20 / 111 | 18.0% | 11 / 16 | 8 / 16 | 2 / 6 |

Floor -4 still improves precision and cuts negatives with hits from 6/6 to 2/6 on both splits, while held-out topical coverage falls from 13/16 to 11/16. Floor 0 removes remaining negative hits and destroys recall.

## Fused 200 under floor -4 (user-visible cutoffs)

Parents that newly entered the floor -4 top ten or top twenty when fused N rose from 100 to 200 were judged blind (no scores, no target IDs). New held-out negative parents in those cutoffs were all judged irrelevant. Remaining unlabeled slots outside that new-parent set are still treated as irrelevant here, so precision is a lower bound.

| Split | Fused N | Cutoff | Relevant / returned | Precision (lower bound) | Positive questions with a relevant hit | Exact target hits | Negative questions with any hit |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Calibration | 100 | 10 | 83 / 168 | 49.4% | 21 / 22 | 15 / 22 | 2 / 6 |
| Calibration | 100 | 20 | 83 / 223 | 37.2% | 21 / 22 | 18 / 22 | 2 / 6 |
| Calibration | 200 | 10 | 89 / 175 | 50.9% | 21 / 22 | 15 / 22 | 2 / 6 |
| Calibration | 200 | 20 | 98 / 238 | 41.2% | 21 / 22 | 18 / 22 | 2 / 6 |
| Held out | 100 | 10 | 20 / 111 | 18.0% | 11 / 16 | 8 / 16 | 2 / 6 |
| Held out | 100 | 20 | 20 / 151 | 13.2% | 11 / 16 | 8 / 16 | 2 / 6 |
| Held out | 200 | 10 | 30 / 125 | 24.0% | 12 / 16 | 9 / 16 | 2 / 6 |
| Held out | 200 | 20 | 40 / 179 | 22.3% | 12 / 16 | 10 / 16 | 2 / 6 |

Held-out floor -4 therefore gains about six precision points at @10 and nine at @20 when fused N moves to 200, with one extra positive question recovering a relevant hit and no extra negative questions gaining hits. Returned-parent counts also rise, so the tool shows more rows when the floor keeps more of the wider candidate pool.

## Latency

On this machine and local endpoints, mean rerank time was about 0.29s for 100 fused chunks (13 HTTP batches at `batch_size=8`) and about 0.56s for 200 chunks (25 batches). Stage A candidate probes across budgets 50/100/200 finished in about 36s for 50 questions. Stage B with rerank for budgets 100 and 200 finished in about 127s. A follow-up index-keyed deepen pass over N=100 and N=200 finished in about 56s. Individual cases stayed under 2s.

## Recommendation

Evidence favors keeping CombinedStore `rrfK=60`. The clear candidate-budget lever is fused N, not RRF k. Do not threshold RRF scores.

1. Prefer **fused candidate N=200** with per-store `maxItems=100` if recovering fused-truncation misses and the held-out @10/@20 gains above matter. Cost: about +0.27s mean rerank latency and 25 instead of 13 rerank requests. Exact held-out targets after rerank rise from 11/16 to 16/16 before a floor; with floor -4 they rise only to 10/16 anywhere, and only to 9/16 @10 / 10/16 @20. The “16/16” figure is candidate retention, not top-ten quality.
2. Keep **per-store budget 100** unless date-filtered overfetch needs separate treatment; budget 200 without fused 200 did not fix the fused-truncation misses.
3. Keep **min_score: -4** optional and model/corpus-specific. On this set it still cuts negatives with hits from 6/6 to 2/6 and raises judged precision, while dropping some exact and topical hits. Widening N under -4 did not revive held-out negatives in the top twenty among newly judged parents.
4. Re-judge if production changes fused N or the floor. Labels for N=100 first-ten topical precision are not a complete label set for N=200 top twenty.

The calibration pass changed no production code or settings. The subsequent production change widened only the fused candidate cap to 200; the optional reranker floor and per-store limits remain unchanged.

## Limits

Judgments are subjective and use short candidate excerpts. The first topical table for N=100 uses labels frozen from that first-ten list. The fused-200 floor -4 table adds blind labels only for parents newly entering top ten or top twenty; other unlabeled parents still count as irrelevant, so those precision figures are lower bounds. Exact-target tables do not have that bias. Hard negatives stress unrelated domains; they do not model near-miss engineering questions. Probe score capture keyed by truncated document text can collide when two memories share the same first 768 characters; production ranking is index-based and unaffected, and exact-rank checks against an index-keyed deepen pass matched for held-out floor -4. Reuse the questions when the corpus or embedding/reranker models change.
